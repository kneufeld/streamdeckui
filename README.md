# Stream Deck UI Framework

This is built on the great work of
[streamdeck](https://github.com/abcminiuser/python-elgato-streamdeck)
but where `streamdeck` is a low level library, `streamdeckui` hopes to
be a high level library that makes writing an app for your Stream Deck
easier.

## Installation

`streamdeckui` is easy enough, `pip install streamdeckui`.

However `streamdeck` is a bit trickier, read how at
[ReadTheDocs](https://python-elgato-streamdeck.readthedocs.io/en/stable/pages/installation.html).

## Example

See [examples/async.py](examples/async.py)
